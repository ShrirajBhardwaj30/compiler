LIST OF KNOWN BUGS:

1) The following does not work:
	#ifdef blabla
	%}
	#endif
   Neither does:
	#ifdef blabla
	}
	#endif
   Neither does:
	#ifdef blabla
	{
	#endif
   But the following works:
	#ifdef blabla
	{ foobar }
	#endif

   In other words: these types of brackets must always be well formed within
   a #ifdef environment.
