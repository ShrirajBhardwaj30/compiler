c.l                      original grammar for parsing yacc that I used
c.y                      original grammar for parsing yacc that I used
primes                   linux executable: prime number generating program
primes.c                 the source code for primes. Very slow, very
                         inefficent. I only needed it for finding a 
                         suitable prime number for a hash table in yaccviso.
primestable.txt          output of primes
yaccviso_grammar.txt     The current grammar for yaccviso. Stripped of all
                         actions but otherwise identical to ../src/yaccviso.y
